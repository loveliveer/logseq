- Dear Bob,
- I am very delight to recall the time I live in your house.I am writing for the purpose of returning a music CD, which I forgot to return when I come back from Canada.
- 
- You always tell me that don't fear to face our mistake because fear can kill your dream, fear can put put people in the hospital and paralyze you.
- I can't forgive your guide forever. It is your warmhearted help can give me safety and convenience. But I make a blunder that I pack briefly and bring your CD back to China.
- I feel so sorry when I see the music in my bag now. I have sent the music CD to your address. Please forgive my mistake.
- I am looking forward to your understanding.
- yours
-
