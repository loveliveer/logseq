- Dear Bob,
- It's so great to recall the past days when I studied in Canada and stayed in your house.
- However, I am writing to apologize because I forgot to return a CD to you.
- I am quite grateful for your kind help and it was your help that enabled me to enjoy a comfortable and fruitful trip of learning in Canada.
- Anyway, compared with you, I am more careless and I did not find your CD in my luggage until I came back to China.
- Accordingly, I intend to to send it back immediately by EMS. Of course, if there is any better solution you prefer, please feel free to inform me.
